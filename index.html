After graduating from ucr I would like to get my Psyd and become a clinical therapist. I would like to use my career to bring mental health awareness to my Middle Eastern community and end the stigma. I have strengths that i believe will help me achieve my goals, but i also have weaknesses that i feel might make achieving my goals difficult. Some of my strengths include that I am observant, curious, energetic, enthusiastic, social, and a great communicator. I see life as a big puzzle meant to be solved, and I believe everything is a part of something bigger. I enjoy forming new connections and ideas and will get excited to share my findings with anyone whoâ€™ll listen. The strength that i believe will aid me the most towards my goal is my communication skills, I enjoy small talk and deep, meaningful conversions, and can steer conversations toward my desired subjects in a way that feels natural and unforced. Unfortunately, like everyone else, I also  have weaknesses, I have poor practical skills, find it difficult to focus, overthink things, get stressed easily, highly emotional, and Iâ€™m independen to a fault. Without more hands on people to help push day to day things along, my ideas are likely to remain just ideas, that may be because it is hard for me to maintain interest as taks drift towards routine, administrative matters, and away from broader concepts. I tend to look for underlying motives in even the simplest things, and that may keep me up at night assuming why someone did what they did, what it might mean, and what I can do about it. Also, although it is easy for me to be close to others, if i feel like i canâ€™t help them or be of some sort of assistance i may get stressed easily. Lastly, because i am highly emotional, particularly when i am under stress, criticism, or conflict, i can experience emotional bursts that are counterproductive. I do believe that my strengths can help me develop my weaknesses, for example my curiosity can help me understand why I may get emotional about a certain situation and help me become more self-aware, and prevent myself from having emotional outbursts. I also think one can take their weaknesses and use them as a strength, for example as a psychologist I can use my overthinking as a way to think about my cases and therefore help myself come up with a smart solution or treatment plan. One area that I definitely think needs improving would be my lack of practical skills because of how easily I get distracted. To work on this I can find a mentor who is willing to help me learn how to finish a task I started, and help me a good way to look at administrative work so I can complete it to the best of my ability and not have it set me back. One skill that I don't believe I need to improve that has helped me and will keep helping me is my people skills. Thankfully I have the ability to communicate well and share ideas with others in an effective manner to achieve my goal and the goals of the people around me.
